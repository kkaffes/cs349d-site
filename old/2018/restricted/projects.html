    <p>The following is a list of potential topics and ideas for your
    CS349d project. These are starting points that will require
    further development. Please reach out to the instructors for futher
    information.</p> 

    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Design an infrastructure for mobile-edge neural network computations. Offload to edge servers or datacenter servers as needed for performance/power or based on data availability. </li>
        <li>In a cloud ML system as new data arrive, how do we decide when to re-train or incrementally train a ML model? How does the cost vs. benefit relate to the model type? What infrastructure is needed to support this?</li>
        <li>ML Serving: Design a system to automatically generate fast model serving code from a data science pipeline in libraries like Pandas and SciKit-Learn, using technology such as <a href="https://www.weld.rs/">Weld</a>.</li>
        <li>ML and Hardware: build a parameter server for distributed ML training that exploits 3D crosspoint memory to increase capacity without introducing performance problems. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Serverless Computing</h3>
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
	  <li>Serveless for high throughput serving systems: Serverless computing is quite popular with low volume serving applications. For high volume serving application (e.g., websearch), people still use traditional server designs. Can we design a serverless system that can execute efficiently the same code both at low and high volume scenarios? </li>
	  <li>Serverless for accelerators: Does it make sense to extend the serverless platforms for FPGAs, and other accelerators? If yes, how does the system look like? </li>
      <li>Build a serverless platform based on slack compute, memory, and storage resources.</li>
	  <li>The economics of serverless: How should one charge for 
          serverless? Alternatively, given the economics and the usage
          characteristics, how should one set the thresholds for constraints
	  (e.g., up to 500 MB disk)? </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Cloud Management</h3>

	<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">

	   <li> ML for cloud management: Several researchers are suggesting the use of reinforcement learning (RL) in cloud management. Select on cloud management task (e.g., resource allocation, scheduling, etc) and build RL solutions to it. </li>

	   <li> Several companies will always need to be partially on-premise or will need to operate using >1 cloud operator. What do you need to change or optimize in cloud frameworks (orchestration, analytics, serving) to deal with multi-cloud case? E.g., how do you optimize around slow inter-cloud networks or reconcile the different security models? </li>
	</li>
	      
	</ul>
    
    <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
	<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
	   <li>Multi-party computation as a service.</li>
       <li>Edge computation as a service: design a platform for running functions on the edge (IOT) while isolating them from each other the way a cloud does. </li>
       <li>Privacy: Implement <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/papers/2017/hotnets_diy.pdf">DIY applications</a> using serverless computing that users can use for a common computing task, such as chat or email. </li>
       <li>Analytics and Privacy: Design a managed storage &amp; analytics stack that automatically respects data privacy regulations such as GDPR (e.g. keeping data for each country inside it). </li>
	</ul>

    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>Storage and Economics: Design a system that automatically compresses data or moves it to faster/slower tiers of storage to minimize cloud cost subject to meeting a certain workload SLA.</li>
        <li>Storage and ML: Design an indexing system for visual data that allows efficient queries based on its representation under a neural network featurizer. For example, consider searching for video frames that are likely to contain a bicycle using the neural networkâ€™s representation.</li>
    </ul>
